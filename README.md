# COMP2000 Kiosk Project

## Information:

- The main project is in ActualCoursework\src
- If you would like to view it in jar format as an artifact: Follow this path: ActualCoursework/out/artifacts/ActualCoursework_jar. You will need to download the .txt files for it use the database in the program which are also in that file

- This folder contains 3 other folders which contain the code
- In the ActualCoursework folder, there are two .txt files and these are used as the stock database and to store admin credentials
- There is a test folder in ActualCoursework which is a folder where a few tests have been completed
- In the past few weeks, I have used the push branch in GitHub to upload my project versions. These have now been deleted and only the latest version is uploaded in the main branch

- Youtube Video which shows a run down of my project:
